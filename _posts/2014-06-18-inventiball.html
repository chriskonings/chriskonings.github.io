  Inventiball is a light-hearted puzzle game that I prototyped in the third year of my university Digital Media Development course.</p>
  <p>
  I collaborated with <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredhemmings" target="_blank" title="jared hemmings">Jared Hemmings</a> to build the game in two weeks. We focussed on the pick-up-and-play value by allowing the user to have fun in short bursts in the form of levels/challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
  Each level gave the player a challenge to move a ball from one end of a grid to another (using provided blocks) whilst avoiding obstacles.
