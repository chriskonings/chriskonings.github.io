      I was hired in to engineering as a Front-End Developer for an API testing product called <a href="https://apitest.ibmcloud.com" alt="IBM API Test" target="_blank">IBM API Test</a>. As the first UI Engineer employed on to the team I started by re-architecting the production CSS/Less and teaching the rest of the team Front-End fundamentals. I contributed to production code using HTML, CSS/Less, Javascript and AngularJS, along with other build processing tools such as Grunt/Gulp.

      I was offered a Front-End Developer role in Design after six months in engineering due to my design background. I was put in a team of Visual Designers, UX Designers and User Researchers. I work closely with my team to design the appropriate user experience, and then build prototypes using HTML, CSS/SCSS and vanilla Javascript to demonstrate the teams desired user experience.

      Upon joining IBM Design I participated in a three month Design Thinking training program in Austin, Texas to learn Design Thinking techniques and apply them to incubation projects with clients such as <a href="http://www.theweathercompany.com/" alt="The Weather Company" target="_blank">The Weather Company</a>.

      Along with my daily commitments I also organize events, attend hackathons and work alongside other Front-End Developers to build the Front-End community within IBM.
