        After graduating with a first-class honours in Digital Media Development, I was invited to lecture

        <a href="http://www.winchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank" title="University Of Winchester">The University of Winchester</a>.

      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>
        As a technical lecturer, I taught students the required technical understanding for each project involving basic Javascript, semantic HTML, CSS animation, and Unity3D game development. I supported students throughout the semester by building template projects, troubleshooting, and giving advice on UX design.
