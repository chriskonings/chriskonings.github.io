  <h3>Product</h3>
  <p>IBM API Test allows the user to check how their app is communicating between the APIs it uses. The user is able to set up a number of tests, compare results and assess the general health of their app by understanding how each API is communicating between each other and whether their app is receiving the correct data.</p>
  <h3>Role</h3>
  <p>I was hired as a front-end engineer and was the first UI-focussed developer on the team. I refactored production HTML and CSS to align with BEM and follow modern practices for maintainable code. I was heavily involved in the interface design process to eventually build a re-usable design library.</p>
