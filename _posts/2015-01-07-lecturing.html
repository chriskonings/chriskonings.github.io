          After graduating with a first-class honours in Digital Media Development, I was invited to lecture
          <a href="http://www.dmd-winchester.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Digital Media">Digital Media</a> students at
          <a href="http://www.winchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank" title="University Of Winchester">The University of Winchester</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>
          As a technical lecturer, I taught students the required technical understanding for each project involving basic Javascript, semantic HTML, CSS animation, and Unity3D game development. I supported students throughout the semester by building template projects, troubleshooting, and giving advice on UX design.
        </p>

        <h3>Talk Topics</h3>
        <p>
          I taught classes twice a week on the following subjects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>UX and Interface Design</li>
          <li>Responsive Design</li>
          <li>Accessibility</li>
          <li>Knowing Your User</li>
          <li>Design Thinking</li>
          <li>The Importance Of Semantics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also taught students the tools they needed to build each project: HTML, CSS, jQuery, vanilla Javascript, Adobe CC, Unity 3D, and Sketch.
