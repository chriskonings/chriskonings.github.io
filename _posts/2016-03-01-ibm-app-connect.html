      I am a front-end developer working with a team of designers and engineers. I work with the design team to ensure a feasible solution that meets user needs and build wireframes and coded prototypes for usability testing. I translate our design decisions to the engineering team and communicate goals and tasks across the board so that deliverables are completed on a timely manner.
