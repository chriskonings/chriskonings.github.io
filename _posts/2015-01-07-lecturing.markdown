    <span class="block margin-s margin-no-top">After graduating with a first-class honours in Digital Media Development I was invited to lecture <a href="http://www.dmd-winchester.org.uk/" target="_blank" alt="Digital Media">Digital Media</a> students at The <a href="http://www.winchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank" alt="University Of Winchester">University of Winchester</a> (Hampshire, UK).</span>
    <span class="content__post-sub-title margin-xs">Role</span>
    <p class="block margin-s margin-no-top">
      As a technical lecturer I taught students to code and generally supported them through their projects each semester. I helped them to work with clients and design solutions whilst ensuring each team-member developed their own skill-sets.
    </p>
    <span class="content__post-sub-title margin-s">Responsibilities</span>
    <p class="block margin-s margin-no-top">
      I taught classes twice a week, this included the fundamentals and technical understanding the students needed to pursue their projects including codebase, tools and architecture.
    </p>
    <span class="content__post-sub-title margin-s">Talk Topics:</span>
    <ul class="bullet-list margin-s">
      <li>UX and Interface Design</li>
      <li>Responsive Design</li>
      <li>Accessibility</li>
      <li>Knowing Your User</li>
      <li>Design Thinking</li>
      <li>The Importance Of Semantics</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="block margin-s margin-no-top">
      I also taught students the tools they needed to build each project: HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, Adobe CC, Unity 3D and Sketch.
    </p>
    <p class="block margin-s margin-no-top">
      I believe an integral part of becoming a professional is learning to teach yourself. I always focussed on teaching my students to enjoy learning and the benefits of surrounding yourself with your work.
