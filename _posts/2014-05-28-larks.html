  <h3>Interactive Theater</h3>
  <p>
  I was invited by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.the-larks.com/" title="The Larks">The Larks</a> to collaborate on a game as part of their latest performance. The game was to include technology to reveal a narrative and challenge players.
  </p>
  <h3>Process</h3>
  <p>
  I worked closely with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/jaredhemmings" title="Jared Hemmings">Jared Hemmings</a> to build the required components, including: pressure-sensitive chairs, remote controls and a logic-fitted rotary phone.
  </p>
  <p>
  We used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/" title="arduino">Arduino</a> to give our components logic and worked with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.the-larks.com/" title="The Larks">The Larks</a> to sync each prop component to video, music and lighting.
  </p>
  <p>
  This was a one week collaboration resulting in a days worth of performances.
