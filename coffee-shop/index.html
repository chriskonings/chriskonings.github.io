      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>
        As the sole full-time Front-End Developer for <a href="http://www.thepaperface.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="the paperface">The Paperface</a> I worked closely with this client and <a href="http://www.thepaperface.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="the paperface">The Paperface</a> designers to build this responsive Wordpress-driven website for a local business.
      </p>
      <h3>The Brief</h3>
      <p>
        The website needed to feel like the business, a small, cute, local coffee shop with period personality and great food. Alongside the lead designer I helped to articulate this throughout the design and establish the websites technical needs, such as: a CMS (Wordpress), responsive layout, a real-time clock, contact form, map and a picture slideshow.
