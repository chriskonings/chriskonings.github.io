  <p>
    After graduating with a first-class honours in Digital Media Development, I was invited to lecture
    <a href="http://www.dmd-winchester.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Digital Media">Digital Media</a> students at
    <a href="http://www.winchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank" title="University Of Winchester">The University of Winchester</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Role</h3>
  <p>
    As a technical lecturer, I taught students the required technical understanding for each project involving basic Javascript, semantic HTML, CSS animation, and Unity3D game development. I supported students throughout the semester by building template projects, troubleshooting, and giving advice on UX design.
  </p>

  <h3>Talk Topics</h3>
  <p>
    I taught classes twice a week on the following subjects:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>UX and Interface Design</li>
    <li>Responsive Design</li>
    <li>Accessibility</li>
    <li>Knowing Your User</li>
    <li>Design Thinking</li>
    <li>The Importance Of Semantics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I also taught students the tools they needed to build each project: HTML, CSS, jQuery, vanilla Javascript, Adobe CC, Unity 3D, and Sketch.
